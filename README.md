# APS360-Group-Project

Currently LoadData only puts images from same runs into their own respective folders. 
The entire dataset is around 35 GB so I will not use that one to test. I will upload an example dataset with only a handful runs.
The example csv and zip files are in our APS360 Google Drive folder.
To run, put both of the csv and zip files in the "Data" folder (you have may have to create this). 
Run LoadData from main directory.
